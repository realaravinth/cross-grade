# Databases:

Some databases store data in architecture-specific formats and cross-grading can make it unusable. So it is crucial to do database dumps before proceeding with the cross-grade.

## Supported databases:
- [Postgresql](postgresql.md)

## Request support:
   Many versions of databases aren't available on the Debian repository, I've tried to write scripts for most of them.
   To request support for a database that you are using, kindly create an [issue](https://github.com/realaravinth/cross-grade/issues)
   ### Format:
   ```
   Name: <Database name>
   website: <Official website>
   repository: <third-party repository (if any)>
   ```
