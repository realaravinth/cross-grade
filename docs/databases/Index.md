# Databases:

Some databases store data in architecture-specific formats and cross-grading can make it unusable. So it is crucial to do database dumps before proceeding with the cross-grade.

## Supported databases:
    * [Postgresql](postgresql.md)

## Request support:
   Kindly create [issues](https://github.com/realaravinth/cross-grade/issues/new) in this repository to request support for the new databases. There are so many of them out there and not all of them are supported by the Debian project so it's difficult for me to create scripts for them if I don't know which one's are out there.

   ### Format:
   ```
   Name: <Database name>
   website: <Official website>
   repository: <third-party repository (if any)>
   ```
## Contributions:
   If you have database dump scripts for the databases that aren't supported, kindly create pull requests!
